## Introduction

Welcome to my website! My name is William “Billy” Johnson, and I’m a graduate student at Colorado State University pursuing a Professional Master of Science in Water Resources. I created this site as a place to share and document my work in hydrology, watershed science, and cold water fisheries.

My academic and professional interests focus on understanding and solving complex water challenges in the Western United States. From snowpack dynamics and streamflow modeling to remote sensing and river restoration, I enjoy working at the intersection of data science and field-based environmental research.

This site showcases a range of projects through both coursework and independent research. Whether you're interested in water resource management, aquatic ecology, or simply curious about how data and ecosystems connect, I invite you to explore and reach out.
